# Detailed Project Explanation  
## Codveda Internship Tasks Breakdown  

This repository contains all tasks completed during my internship at Codveda Technologies. Each level represents increasing complexity — from foundational Python programming to structured data analysis and advanced problem-solving.

## 🏢 Internship Overview

This project was completed as part of a structured internship program at Codveda Technologies, where tasks were grouped into three progressive levels:

- **Level 1 — Basic**

- Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC curve for evaluation.
- Comparing logistic regression with other classifiers like
Random Forest or SVM.

**Purpose:**  
To undering classification using Logistic regression and also determine the best model by comparison.

---

## 📊 Level2-Intermediate_Task3.ipynb  
**Description:** Implement K-Means clustering to group data points into clusters without labels.

**What It Covers:**
- Applying K-Means clustering to the dataset.
- Using the elbow method or silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualising the clusters in 2D space using PCA or t-SNE for dimensionality reduction.

**Tools Used:**
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

**Purpose:**  
To understand clustering and details knowledge of knowing the numbers of optimal clusters in the dataset.

---
