# Codveda Project

This repository showcases the projects I completed during my **one-month internship at Codveda Technologies** — a hands-on internship focused on practical tasks and data projects.

## 📌 About the Internship

During my internship at Codveda Technologies, I worked through multiple levels of data tasks — starting from basic exercises and progressing to intermediate and advanced tasks. These projects helped me solidify my understanding of Python, data manipulation, visualization, and problem-solving in real scenarios.

## 📚 What’s Inside

### 🎯 Level 1 — Basic Tasks
These tasks focus on beginner-level Python programming — fundamentals like Data Collection, Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

### 📈 Level 2 — Intermediate Tasks
Here, I explore Predictive Modeling (Regression) using Python libraries like scikit-learn and work on slightly more complex logic involving data analysis, Classification with Logistic Regression and Clustering (Unsupervised Learning).

### 🧠 Level 3 — Advanced Tasks
Advanced notebooks delve deeper into Time Series Analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Text Classification), and Neural Networks with TensorFlow/Keras; using libraries like statsmodels, nltk, TensorFlow, just to mention a few.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used for visualizations)
- BeautifulSoup, Natural Language toolkit (nltk), scikit-learn, statsmodels, TensorFlow

> 🚀 Most of the work is written in **Jupyter Notebooks** to help in visualization, with a few Python scripts.

## 📌 How to Run

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoshoodSO/Codveda-Project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the folder:**

   ```bash
   cd Codveda-Project
   ```
3. **Install dependencies (if needed):**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: Create a `requirements.txt` file with libraries like pandas and matplotlib if not already included.*
4. **Open notebooks:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
